title: Interested in Moving Your Meetup Online?
---

Current events have caused the cancellation of face-to-face meetups.  I personally love attending meetups, and have been saddened by the number of cancellations that have been appearing in my inbox.

However, even with millions of us quarantined of self-isolated in our homes, we can still hold a virtual Meetup watching and sharing information.

Many Meetups already have a Slack channel for chatting, so all we need to do is add Video. Live streaming video sounds complicated , but [api.video](https://api.video) has built a [video sharing portal](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/twilight-decorous-mail?path=README.md:31:199) for your Meetup.  Your Live Video, and all the recorded videos are all organised on one simple page!  Just 3 simple steps, and you are ready to go with your online meetup streaming.

If you'd like to host your Meetup Live Stream on api.video, we'd love to give you a coupon for 10 free hours of video streaming &amp; storage (that's 5 hours of streaming, and 5 hours of perpetual storage).  Plenty of bandwidth to keep your meetup group going for the next couple of months!

Email us at <a href="mailto:doug@api.video">doug@api.video</a> for your coupon.  If you have any questions, head over to our <a href="https://community.api.video">community forum</a>.
